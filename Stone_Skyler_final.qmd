## Data Description

Unmanaged Areas (0 years): Typically, lower species richness due to invasive species like buckthorn dominating.

Early-Stage Management (10 years): An intermediate increase in species richness as invasive species are removed and native species are reintroduced.

Late-Stage Management (20 years): Highest species richness, reflecting successful restoration with sustained management efforts.

## Describing the data, with uncertainty

```{r}
# Calculate descriptive statistics
descriptive_stats <- diversity %>%
  group_by(ManagementStage) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(SpeciesRichness),
    sd = sd(SpeciesRichness),
    cv = sd / mean,
    se = sd / sqrt(n())
  )

kable(descriptive_stats, caption = "Descriptive Statistics")
```


###### 95% confidence intervals of `SpeciesRichness` for each `ManagementStage`

```{r}
ci <- diversity %>%
  group_by(ManagementStage) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(SpeciesRichness),
    se = sd(SpeciesRichness) / sqrt(n()),
    lower_ci = mean - qt(0.975, df = n() - 1) * se,
    upper_ci = mean + qt(0.975, df = n() - 1) * se
  )

ci_table <- kable(ci)

ci_table
```

## Hypothesis Testing

There is no overlap in the confidence intervals for 0years and 10years or 20years, so therefore 0years is completely different from 10years and 20years. There is, however, overlap in the confidence intervals for 10years and 20years, so therefore they are not significantly different from each other. 

**Inference:** Given that 10years and 20years are not different from each other, if 20years is different from 0years, then 10years must also be different from 0years. 

## Comparing two means

**Null Hypothesis:** The biodiversity of buckthorn thickets is no different from the biodiversity of buckthorn thickets after continued restoration over time.

###### Two-sample Welch's t-test
```{r}
# Hypothesis Testing ----
# Subset data for 10years and 20years
data_10years <- diversity %>%
  filter(ManagementStage == "10years")

data_20years <- diversity %>%
  filter(ManagementStage == "20years")

# Perform two-sample t-test
t_test <- t.test(data_10years$SpeciesRichness, data_20years$SpeciesRichness, var.equal = FALSE)

# Create a data frame for the results
results <- data.frame(
  Statistic = c("t-value", "Degrees of Freedom (df)", "P-value", "95% Confidence Interval", "Mean of 10years (x)", "Mean of 20years (y)"),
  Value = c("-2.4101", "113.19", "0.01756", "(-1.6398293, -0.1601707)", "6.733333", "7.633333")
)

# Generate the HTML table
html_table <- kable(results, format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:50%;'", caption = "Welch Two Sample t-test Results")

# Print the HTML table
html_table
```
## Handling Violations of Assumptions
**Violations:**
1. Data are normally distributed within each group
2. The variances of the two groups are equal (homogeneity of variance)

**Transformation:** Most of the data is not normally distributed, so therefore either a log transformation, a square root transformation, or a Box-Cox transformation may make the data more normal. 

**Assumptions of a Mann-Whitney U-test:** 
1. two samples are independent
2. observations are ordinal (e.g. they can be ranked)

**The data does meet the assumptions for a Mann-Whitney U-test**

```{r}
wilcox_test <- wilcox.test(data_10years$SpeciesRichness, data_20years$SpeciesRichness)

# Extracting W and P-value
W <- wilcox_test$statistic
p_value <- wilcox_test$p.value

# Print W and P-value
cat("Mann-Whitney U-test (Wilcoxon rank sum test) results:\n")
cat("W:", W, "\n")
cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")
```
The P-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, and therefore, indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between `SpeciesRichness` of the 10years and 20years `ManagementStages`. 

## ANOVA (analysis of variance)

```{r}
# Perform ANOVA
anova_results <- aov(SpeciesRichness ~ as.factor(ManagementStage), data = diversity)
summary(anova_results)
```
```{r}
ggplot(diversity, aes(x = ManagementStage, y = SpeciesRichness, fill = ManagementStage)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of SpeciesRichness by ManagementStage",
       x = "ManagementStage",
       y = "SpeciesRichness")

```

```{r}
# Perform Tukey HSD test
tukey_results <- TukeyHSD(anova_results)

print(tukey_results)
```
```{r}
# Perform Kruskal-Wallis test
kruskal_test <- kruskal.test(SpeciesRichness ~ as.factor(ManagementStage), data = diversity)

print(kruskal_test)
```
The ANOVA results show a significant effect of `ManagementStage` on `SpeciesRichness`. The Tukey HSD test also reveals significant differences between all pairs of `ManagementStages`. The Mann-Whitney U-test results indicate a significant difference in SpeciesRichness between the 10years and 20years `ManagementStages` (p = 0.0108). The Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the ANOVA results, indicating a significant difference in `SpeciesRichness` between the `ManagementStages`. 

## It's not just diversity, it's identity
```{r}
# Stacked histograms for AverageC
ggplot(diversity, aes(x = AverageC, fill = as.factor(ManagementStage))) +
  geom_histogram(position = "stack", binwidth = 0.5, color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Stacked Histograms of AverageC by Management Stage",
    x = "Average C",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Management Stage"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
means_table <- diversity %>%
  group_by(ManagementStage) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_SpeciesRichness = mean(SpeciesRichness),
    mean_AverageC = mean(AverageC)
  )

kable(means_table)
```

The `SpeciesRichness` before restoration efforts is very low, and there is a substantial increase in `SpeciesRichness` after 10years of restoration efforts increases significantly. There is a smaller increase from 10years to 20years, indicating that the rate of increase has slowed, but stays positive nonetheless. This suggests that while new species continue to establish, competitive dynamics and ecological succession might be limiting further dramatic increases in species numbers. 

The AverageC pattern is similar, with it being very low at 0years, medium at 10years, and almost doubles for 20 years. This indicates that over time, the restoration efforts are successfully favoring species that are well-suited to the managed conditions, particularly fire-loving prairie species. This shows steady improvement as opposed to the slower rate seen in the plot. 

## Computer-intensive methods
```{r}
# Perform one-sample t-test
one_sample_test <- t.test(data_20years$AvgOverSppC, mu = 1)

print(one_sample_test)
```
Based on the t-test alone, it seems that we are not yet at the point where `AvgOverSppC` is significantly greater than 1, although the mean is slightly above 1. 
```{r}
# Histogram of AvgOverSppC
ggplot(data_20years, aes(x = AvgOverSppC)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of AvgOverSppC for ManagementStage = 20years",
       x = "AvgOverSppC",
       y = "Count")

```
```{r}
# Function to calculate median AvgOverSppC
bootstrap_median <- function(data, n = 10000) {
  medians <- numeric(n)
  for (i in 1:n) {
    resample <- data[sample(1:nrow(data), replace = TRUE), ]
    resample$AvgOverSppC <- resample$AverageC / resample$SpeciesRichness
    medians[i] <- median(resample$AvgOverSppC, na.rm = TRUE)
  }
  return(medians)
}

# Perform bootstrap
set.seed(05312024)
bootstrap_results <- bootstrap_median(data_20years)

# Plot histogram of bootstrap replicates
ggplot(data.frame(bootstrap_results), aes(x = bootstrap_results)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap Distribution of Median AvgOverSppC",
       x = "Median AvgOverSppC",
       y = "Count")

```
```{r}
# Calculate mean, median, and 95% CI
boot_mean <- mean(bootstrap_results)
boot_median <- median(bootstrap_results)
boot_ci <- quantile(bootstrap_results, c(0.025, 0.975))

results <- data.frame(
  Statistic = c("Bootstrapped Mean", "Bootstrapped Median", "95% CI Lower", "95% CI Upper"),
  Value = c(boot_mean, boot_median, boot_ci[1], boot_ci[2])
)

kable(results)

```

The bootstrapped interpretation is significantly different from the one-sample t-test interpretation, as the bootstrapped mean and mean are both well below 1. The 95% confidence interval is entirely below 1, meaning that the `AvgOverSppC` is significantly less than 1 according to the bootstrapped results. The bootstrap analysis is more robust than the one-sample t-test, and therefore, we can conclude that further work is needed to improve the composition of species in the restoration area. The above histogram confirms these results. 

## Correlation
```{r}
# Calculate correlation
cor_results <- cor.test(diversity$TotalCover, diversity$SpeciesRichness)

# Correlation results
correlation_results <- data.frame(
  Statistic = c("t-value", "Degrees of Freedom (df)", "P-value", "95% CI Lower", "95% CI Upper", "Correlation Coefficient"),
  Value = c(10.307, 139, "< 2.2e-16", 0.5530542, 0.7426924, 0.6581903)
)

# Create HTML table
kable(correlation_results, format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:50%;'", caption = "Pearson's Product-Moment Correlation Results")
```
###### Check Assumptions: Linearity
```{r}
# Scatterplot of TotalCover vs. SpeciesRichness

ggplot(diversity, aes(x = SpeciesRichness, y = TotalCover)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of TotalCover vs. SpeciesRichness",
       x = "SpeciesRichness",
       y = "TotalCover")

```

###### Check Assumptions: Normality
```{r}
# QQ plots for TotalCover and SpeciesRichness
qqnorm(diversity$TotalCover, main = "QQ Plot of TotalCover")
qqline(diversity$TotalCover, col = "red")

qqnorm(diversity$SpeciesRichness, main = "QQ Plot of SpeciesRichness")
qqline(diversity$SpeciesRichness, col = "red")

```
###### Spearman Rank Correlation
```{r}
# Perform Spearman rank correlation
spearman_test <- cor.test(diversity$TotalCover, diversity$SpeciesRichness, method = "spearman")

# Extract Spearman's rho
spearman_rho <- spearman_test$estimate

# Add Spearman's rho to the results table
spearman_results <- data.frame(
  Statistic = c("Spearman's rho"),
  Value = c(spearman_rho)
)

# Combine Pearson and Spearman results
combined_results <- rbind(correlation_results, spearman_results)

# Create HTML table
kable(combined_results, format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:50%;'", caption = "Correlation Results for TotalCover and SpeciesRichness")

```
###### Interpretation
**Linearity:** 
The relationship does not appear linear. It appears to be mostly random, with a very slight correlation. The correlation coefficient, though, indicates a medium-strength relationship. Therefore, there is a medium-strength linear relationship.

**Normality:** The points do not deviate significantly from the line, indicating that both `TotalCover` and `SpeciesRichness` are roughly normally distributed. 

**Given that normality is not violated, we proceed with the Pearson's product-moment correlation.**

There is a strong positive correlation between `TotalCover` and `SpeciesRichness`, supporting Tilman's hypothesis that greater species diversity promotes greater productivity. The Spearman's correlation also indicates a positive correlation, although it is weaker than Pearson's correlation. While the relationship is positive, it might not be perfectly linear, which can be seen in the scatterplot.
