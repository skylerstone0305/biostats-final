## Exploratory Data Analysis
![Display of Species Richness for the three Management Stages](results/data_display.png)

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Data Description

Unmanaged Areas (0 years): Typically, lower species richness due to invasive species like buckthorn dominating.

Early-Stage Management (10 years): An intermediate increase in species richness as invasive species are removed and native species are reintroduced.

Late-Stage Management (20 years): Highest species richness, reflecting successful restoration with sustained management efforts.
